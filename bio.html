	  <p> <a href=""></a><img src="../images/img_1.jpg" width="250" height="157" alt=""/> <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Zanzibar offers something for everyone, whether you're in search of beautiful beaches or an unforgettable adventure. After trekking to this Indian Ocean destination off of the eastern coast of Africa, you'll instantly feel at ease as you lounge on quiet beaches like Matemwe and Pongwe. Once you've gotten your fill of the archipelago's beaches, visit Zanzibar City's UNESCO World Heritage-listed Stone Town, where you'll find the ruins of a 15th-century palace and a graveyard with ties to Zanzibar's former Arab royals. No trip would be complete without taking a spice tour in the countryside and exploring Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park.</span></p>

Straddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is roughly twice as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most impressive waterfalls. To see the natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit here in April when the region's rainy season has concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool. When you're not enjoying the view from above, go swimming or whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the falls from a different angle. </span></p>

In addition to its animal-filled plains, Tanzania boasts otherworldly natural wonders, including red-hued Lake Natron, Ngorongoro Conservation Area's expansive crater and Mount Kilimanjaro â€“ the tallest mountain in Africa. For the ultimate adrenaline rush, book a climbing excursion up the continent's famous mountain through a local tour operator. </span>
